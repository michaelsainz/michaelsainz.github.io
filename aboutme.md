Oh hi! Nobody reads these here, but I'm glad that you stopped by! Here are a few things you might be interested in...

- I'm a former IT Professional turned Developer (technically Systems Developer). Yes, I can read the tea leaves and see where the tech sector is heading. I only wish some of my collegues could as well.
- I'm a technology/DevOps evangelist. And I'm super passionate about it. I currently work as a DevOps engineer for [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com).
- I'm a former career consultant. I've had the privelege of seeing some rather interesting solutions and technology implementations. I have a pretty good sense of what can/should work and what won't.
- I'm a family guy... wife with two daughters that I absolutely adore.
- I love PowerShell.
